You are a new recruit in a secret Missouri S&T research lab called Mo Dehghani’s Code Initiative. The lab is hidden underneath the Puck, the campus landmark that only looks like an oversized granite hockey puck. In reality, it’s the disguised entrance to one of the most advanced computing facilities in the Midwest. Your job: design the next-generation AI to defend the world against a mysterious cyber-threat.

A rogue AI system known only as TJ was accidentally unleashed during an undergraduate project gone wrong in the Computer Science building. TJ now infects digital systems across Rolla including MinerLink servers and the traffic lights on Bishop Ave. — and only your code can stop its rampage.

You’ve just been cleared for your first mission in the Mo Dehghani’s Code Initiative. From the underground lab beneath the Puck, you’re tasked with building a system that can handle streams of encrypted messages intercepted from TJ.

The messages arrive in a chain, one after another, but their order and relevance change constantly. You need a flexible data structure to manage insertions, deletions, and traversal efficiently.
